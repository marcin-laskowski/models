[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is a web platform introduced by Google. It allows you very easily build and train a machine learning model practically with no code.

In order to run your own model trained with [Image](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image):

1. Download `keras_model.h5` file and `labels.txt` by exporting Keras (Tensorflow) version. 
2. Unzip downlaoded package and substitute files in the `data` directory.
3. Model is ready to deploy!

## Deploy 
Click a button to deploy a model with [Syndicai](https://syndicai.co).
